# Machine_Learning
Several different project on Machine Learning mostly using PyTorch. Starting from basic linear regression, classification etc. Moving to Computer Vision and customizing pretrained models such as EfficientNet_B0 for solving image classification problems using Transfer Learning. Finally will add projects related to paper replicating and model deployment using cloud services.
